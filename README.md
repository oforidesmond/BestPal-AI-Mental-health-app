BestPal AI Mental Health Application

The core functionality of this React Native application is an AI chatbot for mental health counseling which is designed with the aim of addressing some objectives such as: 
1) Accessibility to all categories of people
2)  Affordability for individuals who may have limited resources
3) personalization in favor of different kinds of individuals
4) extensive support for everyone, and continuous improvements.

By attaining such objectives, the project aims to provide a boost to the advancements of mental health counseling by utilizing the power of AI. This will make it more accessible, affordable, and personalized for people who are in need of mental health support.

The second core functionality in the application is a mentor assistance system. Logged-on Users of the app who have been veted on their claims of the qualifications that they have can mentor others who are on the app. This enables users who have a particular issue to search for mentors who have experience dealing with that issue and have real time conversations with them in order to get the help they need.  

There are other aspects of the application such as pages for excersizes which have been researched and are good for aiding with mental health symptoms and an appointment booking system for booking a longer sitdown with a mentor.
